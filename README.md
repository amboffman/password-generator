In this program, you'll be able to generate a secure, randomly generated, password between 8 and 128 characters.
When you hit "Generate Password" you'll be asked how long you'd like your password to be. Please input a number between 8 and 128. You will then be asked what type of characters you'd like to include in your password. Hit confirm to include and cancel to omit.
The generator will create your password for you to copy and use at your leisure.

Feel like making a different password? Just his "Generate Password" again.
